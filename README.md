# [Udacity Master of Science in AI](https://www.udacity.com/masters-artificial-intelligence)

This repository contains my work completed during Udacity's Master of Science in AI program.

From Udacity's website:
>The core curriculum has seven required Nanodegree programs covering in-demand topics in AI, from AI Programming with Python to Agentic AI and beyond. The learning path can be customized by choosing from elective Nanodegree programs to complete the remaining credits.

## Core Nanodegree Programs (7)
The foundation has seven required Nanodegrees covering AI programming, data science, machine learning, cloud, and applied AI use cases.

- [AI Programming with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089)
- [Statistics for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/statistics-for-data-analysis-nanodegree--nd588)

## Elective Nanodegree Programs (14)
These are the Nanodegrees I chose as electives where 750 hours are required. I overloaded a bit with 817 hours since I wanted to learn React.
